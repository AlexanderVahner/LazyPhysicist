<h2>LazyOptimizer —</h2>

<p>is a plugin that helps to fill the plan optimizer based on the user's previously created plans.
Plan data is taken from the SQLite database, which is filled in by the PlansCache app.<br>
Optimizer templates are not lazy enough.<br>
The selection of a suitable plan is based on the number of fractions, single dose, treatment machine, 
technique and, most importantly, patient's structures.</p>
